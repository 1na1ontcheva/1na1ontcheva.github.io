### Blogging

[Ctrl+V Podcast](https://www.scalefocus.com/blog/podcast)

_I began by pitching a project proposal to the marketing team, focusing on the benefits of creating a versatile tool that will expand the reach of our company's content, as well as the ability to capture and build a strong relationship with clients. The podcast Ctrl+V was created to engage and strengthen our online presence and community. The episodes deliver valuable, up-to-date information on tech trends and highlight the specter of our solutions and services through guest expert interviews. A Blubrry plugin was installed on Wordpress, so the podcast could be self-hosted._

 [Technical Insights](https://www.scalefocus.com/insights/tap-into-the-potential-of-energy-data-analytics-using-streaming)
 
 _The Technical Insights section is a set of blog articles which analyze the challenges businesses are facing today, and introduce different ways technologies can help solve them. The blog post process starts by reviewing the campaign calendar and receiving a brief for a new content piece. Then, it moves to collaborating on topics with the sales team, and establishing the topic. Meetings are booked for SME interviews in which services and solutions are discussed and linked to the topic. What follows is the writing and editing of drafts, before a final one gets approved to be published in Wordpress and shared on social media._
